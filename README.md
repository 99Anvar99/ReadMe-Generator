Upon successful access, ensure the installation of the INQUIRER package. This step is crucial for the proper functioning of the README generator.

Proceed to execute the command "node index.js" within the command line prompt.

Subsequently, a series of inquiries will be presented, soliciting input relevant to the README generation process and its specific parameters.

Lastly, upon completion, the process will yield an "readme.md" file within the project directory, finalizing the generation procedure.
